                <p style="font-size:15px;width:550px;">Date Finished: July 2022<br><br><br>
                    This book is written in a 12 part Q&A. Each question is one that Paul Little, the author, has heard from 
                    colleges numerous times. I liked this point, because I can use this to back up my claims for Christianity 
                    and clearly define some for non-Christians I meet. Some of these questions even I ask a lot. Contrasted to 
                    CS Lewis, in his answers, Little uses more scripture and scientific works to back up his claims. This book 
                    was more apologetic than Mere Christianity, because it serves a different purpose. Mere Christianity is a 
                    look at the need for Christ and morality through philosophical reasoning; Little uses scripture and scientific 
                    evidence to back-up claims. As someone who wants to memorize and know more scripture in general, these 
                    claim-backing verses are super useful. He adds to CS Lewis arguments at times, such as when he 
                    counters the ‘Legend’ argument to the Trilemma. He delves into a little scientific work too, which is intertesting as
                    he used a lot of other scientific work to back up claims and gave his views on a few topics without stating his 
                    overall view on the whole argument. For example, he leaves the question of whether the big bang happened or the age of the earth
                    open, for us to decide if there is enough evidence for either side. Of course, he states the clear importance of Jesus
                    and our salvation, not to be overshaadowed by third tier arguments. Overall, this book is a guide to some tough intellectual
                    questions about Christinaity which can help me and the unbeliever alike.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'Edu TAS Beginner', cursive;">The Screwtape Letters by C.S.  Lewis is a 
                        classic masterpiece of religious satire that entertains readers with its sly and ironic portrayal 
                        of human life and foibles from the vantage point of Screwtape, 
                        a highly placed assistant to "Our Father Below."</p>

                    <p style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'Edu TAS Beginner', cursive;"> Told from the viewpoint of Psyche’s sister, 
                        Orual, Till We Have Faces is a brilliant examination of envy, betrayal, loss, blame, grief, guilt, and conversion. 
                        In this, his final—and most mature and masterful—novel, 
                        Lewis reminds us of our own fallibility and the role of a higher power in our lives.</p>
