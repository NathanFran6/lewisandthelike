                <p style="font-size:15px;">Date Finished: July 2022<br><br><br>
                    This book is written in a 12 part Q&A. Each question is one that Paul Little, the author, has heard from 
                    colleges numerous times. I liked this point, because I can use this to back up my claims for Christianity 
                    and clearly define some for non-Christians I meet. Some of these questions even I ask a lot. Contrasted to 
                    CS Lewis, in his answers, Little uses more scripture and scientific works to back up his claims. This book 
                    was more apologetic than Mere Christianity, because it serves a different purpose. Mere Christianity is a 
                    look at the need for Christ and morality through philosophical reasoning; Little uses scripture and scientific 
                    evidence to back-up claims. As someone who wants to memorize and know more scripture in general, these 
                    claim-backing verses are super useful. He adds to CS Lewis arguments at times, such as when he 
                    counters the ‘Legend’ argument to the Trilemma.  </p>

            <p>"We want cattle who can finally become food; 
                He wants servants who can finally become sons." (Letter VIII)</p>
            <p>"Indeed, the safest road to Hell is the gradual one- the gentle slope, 
                soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts" (Letter XII)</p>
            <p>"He [The Enemy] wants each man, in the long run, to be able to recognize all creatures (even himself) 
                as glorious and excellent things. He wants to kill their animal self-love as soon as possible; 
                but it is His long-term policy, I fear, to restore to them a new kind of self-love - 
                a charity and gratitude for all selves." (Letter XIV)</p>
            <p>"Leave them to discuss whether 'love' or patriotism, or celibacy, or television are good or bad. 
                Can't you see there's no answer? Nothing matters at all except the 
                tendency of a given state of mind, in given circumstances, 
                to move a particular patient at a particular moment nearer to the Enemy or nearer to us." (Letter XIX)</p>
            <p>"Prosperity knits a man to the World. He feels that he is 'finding his place in it,' 
                while really it is finding its place in him." (Letter XXVIII)</p>

                        classic masterpiece of religious satire that entertains readers with its sly and ironic portrayal 
                        of human life and foibles from the vantage point of Screwtape, 
                        a highly placed assistant to "Our Father Below."</p>
