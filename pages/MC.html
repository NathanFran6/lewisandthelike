                <h1 style="font-family: 'Edu TAS Beginner', cursive;">Mere Christianity <br>C.S. Lewis</h1>
                <p style="font-size:15px;">Date Finished: July 2022<br><br><br>
                    Even though I have been raised Christian and taught many doctrines he teaches in this book,                         
                    I think Lewis puts all of these into poetic but concise language that anyone can really grasp.
                    I found myself putting quotes down from the book every other page because of how memorable and 
                    thoughtful his words are. I would say my favorite section is the Christian Life. The first chapters 
                    are more of a proof of Christianity and why it is needed. This is needed for any doubters, of course, 
                    but the later chapters applied to Christian life and how we should live out our everyday. </p>

            <p>"But whenever we do good to another self, just because it is a self, made
                (like us) by God, and desiring its won happiness as we desire outs, we shall 
                have learned to love it a little more." (Book 3, Charity)</p>
            <p>"A serious moral effort is the only things that will bring you to the point where you throw up the sponge, 
                Faith in Christ is the only things to save you from despair at that point: 
                and out of Faith in Him good actions must inevitably come." (Book 3, Faith)</p>
            <p>"If you simply ask your conscience, you get one result; if you remember that you are dressing up as Christ, 
                you will get a different one...The real Son of God is at your side. 
                He is beginning to turn you into the same kind of thing as Himself." (Book 4, Let's Pretend)</p>
            <p>"God became man to turn creatures into sons: not simply 
                to produce better men of the old kind but to produce a new kind of man (Book 4, Nice People or New Men)</p>
            <p>"Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. 
                But look for Christ and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in. (Book 4, The New Men)</p>

    <div class="FAQ">
        <h3>FAQ (By Me)</h3>
        <p>A question of salvation by works?</p>
        <p>In this book, C.S. Lewis talks a lot about small choices that bring us closer to a hellish or heavenly creature.
            This choices, he says, add up a the end of our life. At first, I was confused. Does Lewis imply that these choices 
            are what counts toward our salvation and getting to Heaven. But then I referenced where he mentioned these ideas.
            Lewis was merely talking about morality in this world. Our salvation, of course, lies in our faith. But the morals
            which we live our life by get cloudier...

                    <p style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'Edu TAS Beginner', cursive;">The Screwtape Letters by C.S.  Lewis is a 
                        classic masterpiece of religious satire that entertains readers with its sly and ironic portrayal 
                        of human life and foibles from the vantage point of Screwtape, 
                        a highly placed assistant to "Our Father Below."</p>

                        anything? What does the Christian faith teach about God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit? What do I need to know 
                        about angels, Satan and demons? What place should the Bible or a church have in my life? By exploring these 
                        and other core questions, bestselling author Paul E. Little leads you into a greater appreciation of a 
                        God who has done great things to bring you into a relationship with him through Jesus Christ.</p>
