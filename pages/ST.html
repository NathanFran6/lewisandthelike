                <h1 style="font-family: 'Edu TAS Beginner', cursive;">The Screwtape Letters <br>C.S. Lewis</h1>
                <p style="font-size:15px;">Date Finished: July 2022<br><br><br>
                    My first (besides Narnia) CS Lewis fiction, it explained a lot more than I thought 
                    it would in terms of temptation and errors in a Christian life. I had to start taking 
                    a few notes in the middle of the book because of how much I thought (ironically) Screwtape’s 
                    advice would help me. I’m glad the man in the book had a happy ending, and Screwtape was oddly 
                    joyfully hateful at the end of the book describing God and the angels surrounding the  man. 
                    Some of the chapters were oddly specific cases that Screwtape mentioned, like his whole letter on 
                    Reality and sentiment (letter XXX). It took me a couple of reads before I could grasp what he was saying, 
                    but other chapters were more applicable and entertains (rooting for The Enemy to prevail of course). 
                    , I hadn’t thought much of a personal Devil or angel before this, but I’ll have to rethink 
                    that after reading this book. Themes of diabolical pride and other sins were expressed both here 
                    and Mere Christianity, 
                    so I can see the points CS Lewis tries hard to hit on. </p>

            <p>"We want cattle who can finally become food; 
                He wants servants who can finally become sons." (Letter VIII)</p>
            <p>"Indeed, the safest road to Hell is the gradual one- the gentle slope, 
                soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts" (Letter XII)</p>
            <p>"He [The Enemy] wants each man, in the long run, to be able to recognize all creatures (even himself) 
                as glorious and excellent things. He wants to kill their animal self-love as soon as possible; 
                but it is His long-term policy, I fear, to restore to them a new kind of self-love - 
                a charity and gratitude for all selves." (Letter XIV)</p>
            <p>"Leave them to discuss whether 'love' or patriotism, or celibacy, or television are good or bad. 
                Can't you see there's no answer? Nothing matters at all except the 
                tendency of a given state of mind, in given circumstances, 
                to move a particular patient at a particular moment nearer to the Enemy or nearer to us." (Letter XIX)</p>
            <p>"Prosperity knits a man to the World. He feels that he is 'finding his place in it,' 
                while really it is finding its place in him." (Letter XXVIII)</p>

                        about angels, Satan and demons? What place should the Bible or a church have in my life? By exploring these 
                        and other core questions, bestselling author Paul E. Little leads you into a greater appreciation of a 
                        God who has done great things to bring you into a relationship with him through Jesus Christ.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:15px; font-family: 'Edu TAS Beginner', cursive;"> Told from the viewpoint of Psyche’s sister, 
                        Orual, Till We Have Faces is a brilliant examination of envy, betrayal, loss, blame, grief, guilt, and conversion. 
                        In this, his final—and most mature and masterful—novel, 
                        Lewis reminds us of our own fallibility and the role of a higher power in our lives.</p>
