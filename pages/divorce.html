                <h1 style="font-family: 'Edu TAS Beginner', cursive;">The Great Divorce <br>C. S. Lewis</h1>
                <p style="font-size:15px; width:500px;">Date Finished: August 2022<br><br><br>
                    The Great Divorce is similar to Till We Have Faces in some ways. They both are works of fiction 
                    that tie into Lewis's theology and morality background, and both have interesting themes with 
                    metaphorical beats. But I would The Great Divorce is much more closely related to Lewis's non-fiction 
                    than Till We Have Faces. There is a good preface where he mentions that this work is by no means 
                    supposed to be a theological work on what Heaven and Hell are like. No one knows and no one will 
                    know until we die what those are like. Lewis also includes the very last chapter probably for the 
                    same reason: keeping it a dream diffuses speculation that this is what Lewis's idea of Heaven is. And 
                    I find that favorable, because then we can focus on the morality of an eternal life with God, and not deal 
                    with a highly speculative account of Heaven. Lewis creates a story where he goes along a path into Heaven 
                    from Hell, where he views stories and situations from an outside point of view. Many interesting arguments 
                     brought up, my favorite by far being the Scottish man, whom he calls teacher, explain the selfishness 
                     and self-choice of Hell compared to the reality and joyfulness of Heaven (Chapter 9). I thought the ending, 
                     like Till We Have Faces, could have had a more clear and satisfying situation. The whole pitying vice 
                     was a bit confusing, but had a nice tie-in with Jesus at the end. This book teeters the line between 
                     morality and fiction, which I really enjoyed. 
                    I found a lot of points useful from this book, similar to The Screwtape Letters.

                    <p style="font-size:12px; font-family: 'Edu TAS Beginner', cursive;">  In the classic The Abolition of Man, C.S. Lewis, 
                        the most important Christian writer of the 20th century, sets out to persuade his audience of the importance and 
                        relevance of universal values such as courage and honor in contemporary society. Both astonishing and prophetic, 
                        The Abolition of Man is one of the most debated of Lewisâ€™s extraordinary works. National Review chose it as number 
                        seven on their "100 Best Nonfiction Books of the Twentieth Century."
