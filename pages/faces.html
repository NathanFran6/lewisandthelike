                <h1 style="font-family: 'Edu TAS Beginner', cursive;">Till We Have Faces <br>C. S. Lewis</h1>
                <p style="font-size:15px; width:900px;">Date Finished: August 2022<br><br><br>
                    This was my first novel not in the Narnia series by Lewis (unless you count The Screwtape Letters as a novel). 
                    Lewis uses a common myth and changes one aspect, as he points out in a note at the end. The mere fact of not 
                    seeing clearly changes everything for our main character, Orual. This gives us our first glimpse at the main struggle: 
                    Orual’s contempt and pure anger at the gods. Even when Orual tries to force the ‘Orual of the past’ to not show when 
                    she spends years as the Queen, she is sometimes reminded of her sister being taken from her, loved and then banished 
                    by the same gods who dangled clarity in front of Orual for so long. The end of part 1 is anger. She lays all her 
                    evidence against the gods, opening the old wound of Orual from the past and all the memories: love of Psyche, the 
                    sacrifice, and then the denial and questioning. Lewis could have ended the book at this charge, but that’s 
                    an average move. Instead, he gives the theme a full resolution and gives Orual clarity in Part 2. He starts 
                    by beating Orual down so much she becomes suicidal; question such as “Am I just as selfish as I perceived 
                    Ungit so long ago?”. She finally goes to the Underworld, where she delivers a fiery speech in the climax that 
                    has been building up for over 300 pages. Lewis depicts true anguish and has Orual beg the question, “why?” 
                    “Why must I suffer from confusion where my sister is blessed with truth?” “Why can’t the gods give me an answer?”. 
                    In this final court, the deciding verdict is the resolution to the theme: “I saw well why the gods do not speak 
                    to us openly, nor let us answer. Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we 
                    think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?” To know clarity, one must question with clarity. 
                    In the underworld, Orual finally lays out with the finest language her question, which is, ironically, her answer.
                     The gods, along with Lewis, have a poetic way of words. Lewis is able to caption grief, triumph, depression, 
                     anger, pity, all in a single character by diving into her mind and maturing her til she has a face. 
                     Lewis uses numerous extended metaphors to demonstrate different emotions or thoughts Orual has. The list is too 
                     long to put here, but I was finding myself acting like this was a novel for school the way I pointed out different 
                     devices and call-backs. My only complaint would be at the very end of the book. The Fox does not need to go into a 
                    chapter long story of Psyche’s life after she is banished. 
                    It feels like it was forced in to connect the original myth with the end of the story.
