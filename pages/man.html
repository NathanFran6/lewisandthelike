                <h1 style="font-family: 'Edu TAS Beginner', cursive;">The Abolition of Man <br>C. S. Lewis</h1>
                <p style="font-size:15px; width:900px;">Date Finished: August 2022<br><br><br>
                    In these essays, Lewis expands on the idea of the Natural Law, or as he most commonly calls it, Tao. 
                    He first analyzes elementary education books that make claims such as reflection on nature is not sentimental 
                    reason, but merely a projection of one's emotion. Lewis argues that this could cause the reader to believe 
                    there is no sentimental reason or value to earthly things. From this dangerous hypothesis, Lewis guards Tao 
                    the rest of the book. Tao is the common law that has been around in every society, 'written on our hearts' 
                    as Paul says. To attack Tao is a dangerous and unwarranted position, because as he puts it "If it is rejected, 
                    all value is reject. If any value is retained, it is retained." In the third and final chapter, he gets super 
                    hypothetical and acts the question "How far?". How far will society go in its conquest of Nature? He 
                    presumes that the last thing to be conquered is Human Nature, Tao. After that, they can make their own values from 
                    their impulses. He argues that when Science explains processes, "it would not explain away." The end goal would be 
                    to "buy knowledge at a lower cost than that of life." If we go to far with explaining things, we end up killing 
                    common Reason. He argues that explaining is like making something transparent. If we ended up making everything 
                    transparent, we would live in an invisible world without Tao. This was Lewis' hardest work for me to read by far, 
                    with all the Tao explanation and hypothesis he presents. This is not a theological argument or book, merely a case 
                    for changing education and science. I found a lot of value in recognizing the value of Natural Law and keeping to those 
                    even when Science wants to conquer all Nature. 
                    I would recommend this book to anyone interested in morality or the right way to educate it.
